## Weekly updates
### January
Week 1 (2-5)
- Finalized two-stage rocket design and what sensors we are using.
- Decided on rocket motors and proportions of the rocket.
- Began CAD design for nose cone that will house electronics.  

Week 2 (8-12)

- Ordered fuselage tube and parachute
- Worked on nose cone design to house electronics
- Began writing code for altimeter and mpu 6050.
Week 3 (16-19)
## Design

### CAD

### Code
The code in this project wasn't super difficult although it did need us to cover new concepts that we hadn't before. We used both an altimeter and accerlerometer and had them both copy values into a file held on the pico. 
Initialy we needed to make a code for the altimeter and accerlorometer seperately, We had alread done a project with an accerlometer but the altimeter needed more work. 
Here is the accerlerometer  [code](raspberry-pi/avoid1.py).
