- Decided on rocket motors and proportions of the rocket.
- Began CAD design for nose cone that will house electronics.  

Week 2 (8-12)

- Ordered fuselage tube and parachute
- Worked on nose cone design to house electronics
- Began writing code for altimeter and mpu 6050.
Week 3 (16-19)

### febuary 

Weeks 1-2 (2-16)
- got the 3D printed internals designed and tested
- finished the initial code and began to plan the sodering and final electronics
- started simulations for the rocket and mesured ideal performance.

## Design

our design was conceptualy easy but did require a lot of leg work partitularly from Zach who took lead in researching and designing each individual part. Besides the cardboard tube and the rocket motor all of the pieces to our rocket were 3D printed and hand painted. 




### CAD

### Code
The code in this project wasn't super difficult although it did need us to cover new concepts that we hadn't before. We used both an altimeter and accerlerometer and had them both copy values into a file held on the pico. 
Initialy we needed to make a code for the altimeter and accerlorometer seperately, We had alread done a project with an accerlometer but the altimeter needed more work. 
Here is the accerlerometer  [code](raspberry-pi/avoid1.py).
